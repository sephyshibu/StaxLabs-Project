 Wholesale Marketplace Platform

A modern full-stack wholesale marketplace web application where vendors can list products in bulk, customers can place large quantity orders, and admins manage platform activities. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and TypeScript.

### Toast Notifications

 ### Timezone Handling
To ensure accurate date and time representation across different user locations, we handle timezones explicitly during order placement:

Frontend:
The user's local timezone is detected using the JavaScript Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone API and sent along with the order data
Backend:
The backend receives the timezone string and can use it to store, display, or manipulate date-time values appropriately using libraries like moment-timezone.

This ensures all timestamps (such as order creation time) are correctly contextualized for the userâ€™s local time zone, improving clarity and consistency across global users.
